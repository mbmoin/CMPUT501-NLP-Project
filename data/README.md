### Dataset

The dataset for this task contains approximately 5,000 news headlines obtained from Humicroedit (Hossain et al., 2019) and 8,248 training data obtained from the FunLines competition (Hossain et al., 2020). The zip file downloaded from the proceeding contains two folders for the subtasks, each containing train, test, train_funlines and dev CSV files, which would serve as the input data. That file also contains a baseline output CSV file for metric measurements. 

Here we have the data files that we used for the project. Folders task 1, task 2 contain corresponding to train, test, dev datasets for the tasks.
