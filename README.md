# CMPUT 501 Project - Fall 2021

 ### Task:
The task embarked on for this project is obtained from the SemEval-2020 task-7, titled "Assessing Humor in Edited News Headlines". This task provides a dataset rated by crowdsourcing which contains edited versions of news headlines to make them funny. The project is divided into two subtasks. The first is a regression task aiming to estimate the degree of humor on a scale of 0-3 (0 - Not Funny; 1 - Slightly Funny; 2 - Moderately Funny; 3 - Funny). Second is a classification task to predict the funnier version between the original and edited news headline.
