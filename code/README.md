#### Instructions

1) Upload the .ipynb files in colab, and connect to a runtime
2) By clicking the folder symbol on the left upload all the data related to the specific task (i.e. train.csv, dev.csv, test.csv) from the data folder
3) Go to Runtime and select Run all
4) The section that gets the word embedding takes the most time to run as well as fitting the models in some cases
5) The outputs appear on the left side folder symbol (Files)
